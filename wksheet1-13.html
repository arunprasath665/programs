			<p>
				Tropical  forests are forested landscape in tropic region i.e land areas approximately bounded by tropic of Cancer and Capricon,but possibly affected by other factors such as prevalling winds.Some categories of tropical forest are difficult .while forests in temperate areas are readily categorized on the basi of tree canopy density ,such schemes do not work well in tropical forests.There is no single scheme that defines what a forest is in tropical regions or elsewhere.because of these difficulties ,information on the extent of tropical forests varies between sources.However ,Tropical Forest are extensive ,making up just under half the worlds forests.More than 3.6cm hectares of virgin tropical forest was lost in 2016.
